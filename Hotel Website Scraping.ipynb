      "10.0 - Excelent hotel, we will return to Shangri-La next year.\n",
      "8.0 - The hotel is still in good shape. Rooms are well maintained. 5 restaurants to choose from although prices are high. Even with my gold status they don't allow us to have early check in after arriving from our flight unlike other hotels. Although they have airport shuttle, they still charge additional for that service. What I do like is swimming with the fishes in the beach! The lifeguard even offered feeds to make it more fun. \n",

All these is not expected considering the cost of the room.  Their rate is too much and service is so poor.  I have to ring reception all the time for items I need in the room\n",
      "10.0 - Room was excellent. Clean neighborhood. Courteous staff. My family (with 4 kids),enjoyed our stay....👍👍\n",
